Project Description Information 

our group ( powerpuffgirls ) have created a jobfinder website.
the name of our project is Prospect Connect, we aim to be the bridge between job opportunities 
and users to be able to connect with each other. That is why we named it ‘Prospect Connect’. 
A website that connects and helps individuals who are struggling in finding jobs, we will be there to offer 
them a hand. 

We intentionally created prospect connect in order to help individuals who seek job vacancies. 
Especially now in the advanced age, almost everyone around the world can access the internet just 
by the click of a button. Hence, it is an opportunity for companies to promote their product and 
services online. Even Though there are plenty of job finder websites out there, we plan to make one 
that stands out for users to easily access Prospect Connect.
